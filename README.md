# Project 0

I created this website using HTML, CSS , Bootstrap and Sass.

This website is just a simple introduction of myself. The homepage where i've introduced myself. A page where i've mentioned my academics result till now. & also a page where i've written about my hobbies( i'm kinda weak in expressing things by words so there are like 5-6 lines for each hobby). And lastly a page from where you can reach me on my email .
