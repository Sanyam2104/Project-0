# Project 0

I created this website using HTML, CSS , Bootstrap and Sass.

This website is just a simple introduction of myself. 

INDEX.HTML --  The homepage where i've introduced myself. 

EDUCTION.HTML --  A page where i've mentioned my academics result till now. 

HOBBY.HTML --  In this i've written about my hobbies( i'm kinda weak in expressing things by words so there are like 5-6 lines for each hobby). 

CONTACT.HTML -- And lastly a page from where you can reach me on my email .

IMG FOLDER -- Contains picture that i've used in my project.

SASS -- folder in which the sass stylesheet along with its compiled .css file is present
